            <h3>Sinta-se em casa! Be our guest!</h3>
            <p> Born in 1927 and raised in Östersund in central Sweden, Karin’s creative path began with ceramics. A few
              years into her
              studies at Stockholm’s University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, her interest turned instead to
              furniture and she
              enrolled in the school of the renowned Swedish furniture designer and master craftsman Carl Malmsten.
              Under
              Malmsten’s
              tutorage she learned about craftsmanship, quality and crucially, comfort.</p>
            <br>

            <p> After graduating in 1951, Karin returned to Östersund to help her father Arvid Persson, a civil
              engineer.
              She worked on
              the interior design of his projects, which included apartments, homes and offices. She also continued to
              draw furniture.
              Then, in 1964, a wooden armchair she designed was displayed at the Stockholm Furniture Fair. It was
              spotted
              and admired
              by Ingvar and Karin was hired to join the IKEA design team that same year, working alongside Gillis
              Lundgren, Erik Wørts
              and Bengt Ruda.</p>
            <br>

            <p> She made her debut In the 1966 IKEA catalogue with her peers. It included a number of products designed
              by
              Karin,
              including the PEGGY highchair, NIRAK hall mirror and INGRID chair.</p>

            <h3>Design Flashback</h3>
            <p>By the 1970s Karin had become regarded as one of IKEA’s most productive and trendsetting designers. Her
              furniture design became prolific, from the LONDON series of chairs and footstools in lacquered beech with
              an upholstered seat and back to the AMIRAL armchair, launched in 1970.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Featuring a steel tubing frame with the seat, back and armrests made from high-end saddle leather from a
              local saddle
              maker in Killeberg, AMIRAL was a hit. However, the saddlery couldn’t keep up with the demand for the
              leather details and
              the construction of the frame meant the chair couldn’t be flat-packed, so it was discontinued. It returned
              later in a
              flat-pack version, upholstered in canvas.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Although rooted in classic, rural Scandinavian style, Karin was also a very versatile designer, as her
              back catalogue of
              around 100 IKEA products attests. While the TORPET chair, inspired by the traditional Windsor chair, and
              the NATURA
              armchair illustrated her knowledge and respect for classics and craftsmanship, her KARUSELL coffee table
              made of
              particleboard and KATINKA chair and sofa in bent, lacquered plywood, designed in the popular 60s
              futuristic style,
              tapped into the zeitgeist.</p>

              With the launch of KRUMELUR in 1972, Mobring was targeting a relatively new market for IKEA - the younger
              generation.
              The emergence of youth culture in the 1960s gave birth to a new breed of homemakers who weren’t looking
              for the classics
              found in their parents’ homes. They wanted bold prints, bright colours and new materials, along with
              affordability.

              On the year of its launch, KRUMELUR with its curved, lacquered metal frame and seat constructed from fire
              hose fabric,
              propped with generous cushions, was featured on the front cover of the IKEA catalogue with the modest
              price tag of just
              68 Swedish Kronor.

            <p>They stress that the secret to their success has always been teamwork, from the award-winning LISABO
              table with its
              innovative Wedge Dowel developed by Anders Eriksson and Göran Sjöstedt, to the iconic FRAKTA bag, made in
              collaboration
              with Sven Arne Svensson, Lars-Göran Petterson and Ingvar Kamprad himself. Ingvar came home from Asia with
              a new
              material, traditionally used for rice sacks, with which he wanted to make a bag. Using the sturdy plastic
              material,
              Ingvar and Lars-Göran made a prototype, then tasked the project to the siblings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              They began sketching different sizes and variations, including the yellow bags found in stores and a
              version with a zip
              that could be carried as a rucksack. The latter was inspired by a trip to Japan, where few people were
              able to drive to
              their nearest IKEA store. “This was a typical example of teamwork, that so many competencies were involved
              in the
              project and everyone did their best,” says Marianne.</p>

            <h2> Two glorious careers</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>"We were just eight designers at IKEA when we started." – Knut
            </h4>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2 flex content title-before">
          <div class="tile">
            <p>
              Always guided by the IKEA principles of Democratic Design: function, form, quality sustainability and
              always at a low
              price, they have filled homes around the world with smart, affordable solutions. The process would start
              at the drawing
              board, where Knut and Marianne, or “syskonen” – the siblings – as they were affectionately known by all,
              would draw
              together on a drawing board in 1:1 scale. Then they'd be off to build a prototype with their colleagues in
              the pattern
              shop. Here they would test, evaluate, alter and feedback with suppliers before moving onto the production
              phase.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              But it didn’t stop there. Knut and Marianne have always had a strong interest in the industrial side too.
              Ideas were
              often born on the factory floor as they worked with suppliers to develop new tools and solutions to
              produce better, more
              unique products. “We like to incorporate a handcrafted expression, to give a rational product a feeling of
              craftsmanship,” explains Marianne.

            <p>Prior to Knut and Marianne’s arrival, many of the designers at IKEA specialised in particular areas.
              Designers such as
              Tord Björklund, Karin Mobring and Tomas Jelinek focused on furniture, for example, but this was about to
              change. With
              Knut’s earlier chef's education, the siblings set their sights on designing smaller, more functional
              products for the
              kitchen and the rest of the home.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              “Sven Arne Svensson asked if Marianne and I could be responsible for developing a range of products found
              in restaurant
              kitchens that would work well in homes. Everyone started laughing, saying ‘Ha ha, designing knives and
              forks!’ but five
              or six years later, all the other designers at IKEA were also diversifying and designing objects such as
              knives, etc. It
              was a great journey for us and for IKEA,” recalls Knut.</p>

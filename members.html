              <h3>Sinta-se em casa! Be our guest!</h3>
              <p> Born in 1927 and raised in Östersund in central Sweden, Karin’s creative path began with ceramics. A
                few
                years into her
                studies at Stockholm’s University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, her interest turned instead to
                furniture and she
                enrolled in the school of the renowned Swedish furniture designer and master craftsman Carl Malmsten.
                Under
                Malmsten’s
                tutorage she learned about craftsmanship, quality and crucially, comfort.</p>
              <br>

              <p> After graduating in 1951, Karin returned to Östersund to help her father Arvid Persson, a civil
                engineer.
                She worked on
                the interior design of his projects, which included apartments, homes and offices. She also continued to
                draw furniture.
                Then, in 1964, a wooden armchair she designed was displayed at the Stockholm Furniture Fair. It was
                spotted
                and admired
                by Ingvar and Karin was hired to join the IKEA design team that same year, working alongside Gillis
                Lundgren, Erik Wørts
                and Bengt Ruda.</p>
              <br>

              <p> She made her debut In the 1966 IKEA catalogue with her peers. It included a number of products
                designed
                by
                Karin,
                including the PEGGY highchair, NIRAK hall mirror and INGRID chair.</p>

              <h3>Design Flashback</h3>
              <p>By the 1970s Karin had become regarded as one of IKEA’s most productive and trendsetting designers. Her
                furniture design became prolific, from the LONDON series of chairs and footstools in lacquered beech
                with
                an upholstered seat and back to the AMIRAL armchair, launched in 1970.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Featuring a steel tubing frame with the seat, back and armrests made from high-end saddle leather from a
                local saddle
                maker in Killeberg, AMIRAL was a hit. However, the saddlery couldn’t keep up with the demand for the
                leather details and
                the construction of the frame meant the chair couldn’t be flat-packed, so it was discontinued. It
                returned
                later in a
                flat-pack version, upholstered in canvas.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Although rooted in classic, rural Scandinavian style, Karin was also a very versatile designer, as her
                back catalogue of
                around 100 IKEA products attests. While the TORPET chair, inspired by the traditional Windsor chair, and
                the NATURA
                armchair illustrated her knowledge and respect for classics and craftsmanship, her KARUSELL coffee table
                made of
                particleboard and KATINKA chair and sofa in bent, lacquered plywood, designed in the popular 60s
                futuristic style,
                tapped into the zeitgeist.</p>

                With the launch of KRUMELUR in 1972, Mobring was targeting a relatively new market for IKEA - the
                younger
                generation.
                The emergence of youth culture in the 1960s gave birth to a new breed of homemakers who weren’t looking
                for the classics
                found in their parents’ homes. They wanted bold prints, bright colours and new materials, along with
                affordability.

                On the year of its launch, KRUMELUR with its curved, lacquered metal frame and seat constructed from
                fire
                hose fabric,
                propped with generous cushions, was featured on the front cover of the IKEA catalogue with the modest
                price tag of just
                68 Swedish Kronor.

                table with its
                innovative Wedge Dowel developed by Anders Eriksson and Göran Sjöstedt, to the iconic FRAKTA bag, made

                collaboration
                with Sven Arne Svensson, Lars-Göran Petterson and Ingvar Kamprad himself. Ingvar came home from Asia
                with
                a new
                material, traditionally used for rice sacks, with which he wanted to make a bag. Using the sturdy
                plastic
                material,
                Ingvar and Lars-Göran made a prototype, then tasked the project to the siblings.</p>

              <p>
                They began sketching different sizes and variations, including the yellow bags found in stores and a
                version with a zip
                that could be carried as a rucksack. The latter was inspired by a trip to Japan, where few people were
                able to drive to
                their nearest IKEA store. “This was a typical example of teamwork, that so many competencies were
                involved
                in the
                project and everyone did their best,” says Marianne.</p>

                Always guided by the IKEA principles of Democratic Design: function, form, quality sustainability and
                always at a low
                price, they have filled homes around the world with smart, affordable solutions. The process would start
                at the drawing
                board, where Knut and Marianne, or “syskonen” – the siblings – as they were affectionately known by all,
                would draw
                together on a drawing board in 1:1 scale. Then they'd be off to build a prototype with their colleagues
                in
                the pattern
                shop. Here they would test, evaluate, alter and feedback with suppliers before moving onto the
                production
                phase.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                But it didn’t stop there. Knut and Marianne have always had a strong interest in the industrial side
                too.
                Ideas were
                often born on the factory floor as they worked with suppliers to develop new tools and solutions to
                produce better, more
                unique products. “We like to incorporate a handcrafted expression, to give a rational product a feeling
                of
                craftsmanship,” explains Marianne.

              <p>Prior to Knut and Marianne’s arrival, many of the designers at IKEA specialised in particular areas.
                Designers such as
                Tord Björklund, Karin Mobring and Tomas Jelinek focused on furniture, for example, but this was about to
                change. With
                Knut’s earlier chef's education, the siblings set their sights on designing smaller, more functional
                products for the
                kitchen and the rest of the home.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                “Sven Arne Svensson asked if Marianne and I could be responsible for developing a range of products
                found
                in restaurant
                kitchens that would work well in homes. Everyone started laughing, saying ‘Ha ha, designing knives and
                forks!’ but five
                or six years later, all the other designers at IKEA were also diversifying and designing objects such as
                knives, etc. It
                was a great journey for us and for IKEA,” recalls Knut.</p>
